I"f<p>Social media are now the main source of information for many people. In fact as of February 2021, 38% of adults use social media as a source of news in France, and 76% in Kenya. Regardless of the veracity of the news in twitter, it is a great place to get general news, and especially what people think about it.<br />
So today I asked myself : what is going on in the world, and are the news great or not. To answer these questions, we need 2 things :</p>
<ul>
  <li>a way to collect tweets from tweeter</li>
  <li>a way to determine if the tweets are conveying a general positive sentiment or not.</li>
</ul>
