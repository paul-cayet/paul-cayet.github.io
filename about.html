<p>Currently a senior year student at CentraleSupÃ©lec in Paris, I am passionate about artificial intelligence and
    excited by the opportunities given by recent research in machine learning, deep learning and reinforcement
    learning.</p>

<p>At CentraleSupÃ©lec I study a variety of math and computer science oriented subjects among which optimization, machine
    learning and artificial intelligence, and I wish to specialize in machine learning.</p>
